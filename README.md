# Bachellors-thesis-code-backup

This is the main C code from my bachelor's thesis that runs in a Freescale microcontroler, namely in the M52259DEMOKIT developer board. It was developed with a lot of technical help from my thesis director (like accesing a memory sector) but the logic and algoritms in the application where fully developed by me. One of the biggest challenges for me was to benchmark the generated cryptogram through different statistical tests, in order to comply with security requirements (stated by NIST 140-2).

It is a secure acces system with fingerprint as user identification, the fingertip's minutiae are saved with the chaos-based thesis proposed algorithm, so it is imposible to steal the biomemtric data.
