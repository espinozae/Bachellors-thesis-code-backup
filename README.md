# Bachellors-thesis-code-backup

This is the main C code from my bachelor's thesis that runs in a Freescale microcontroler, namely in the M52259DEMOKIT developer board. It was developed with a lot of technical help from my thesis director (like accesing a memory sector) but the logic and algoritms in the application where fully developed by me.

It is a secure acces system with fingerprint as user identification, the fingertip's minutiae are saved with the chaos-based thesis proposed algorithm, so it is imposible to steal the biomemtric data.
